Samay Prabhu - Measured data such as masses, distance traveled, and time for cart to reach end of rail. Assisted in the physical setup of the lab and checked over the calculations. Wrote multiple parts of the lab as well as concluded the results.

Siddharth Kedharnath - Assisted in the measuring of data, completed calculations, and setup of the physical lab. Wrote multiple parts of the lab as well and concluded the results.

Joel D'Souza - Setup the physical aspects of the lab and performed the main calculations for all the data needed. Proved that our data supported Newton's second law.

Daniel Altman - Measured data for more accurate results and constructed free body diagrams. Assisted in the derivation of the acceleration formula.
