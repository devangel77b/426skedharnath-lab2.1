This experiment tested Newton’s Second Law of Motion (Tipler and Mosca, Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Fifth Edition) [1], \textit{F = ma}, by examining the relationship between the applied force, the mass of a system, and its resulting acceleration. A cart was placed on a rail and connected to a hanging mass via a pulley system. By varying the hanging mass, the experiment allowed for changes in both the total system mass and the applied force. This design provided a range of conditions under which the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration could be analyzed. Measurements of the applied gravitational force from the hanging mass and the cart's acceleration were used to evaluate if the acceleration matched theoretical predictions based on \textit{F = ma}. Results showed a proportional relationship between force and acceleration for a given mass, supporting Newton’s Second Law[1].
